Problems:
1) Comma issue - software runs just if comma is "."
                 Windows7 : Control Panel/Region and Language/Formats/Additional Settings 
				 Setting comma just in Excel is not good enough.
2) Do not forget to enable macros				 
3) IdPort - Do not forget to add Solver library
   a) Open Excel
   b) Add Solver library
   c) close Excel
   d) open Excel
   e) open IdPort
   f) enable macros
   g) click MENU
   If software does not work close IdPort and open it again.
   Do not open IdPort just double-clicking to IdPort, open Excel first.
   IdPort makes almost no problems if using Excel 2016.
   IdPort runs just in Excel 2010 and better, rest of two work also in Excel 2007.
